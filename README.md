K2RolesImportExport
===================

A utility that allows you to export and import K2 roles from one environment to the other.
The project's main page is on k2 Underground: http://www.k2underground.com/groups/k2_blackpearl_roles_import_export_util/default.aspx


Open Source
===========
This software is open source. You're allowed to do with it whatever you want. It's released with the WTFPL license http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/ :-)
I really would like change you make to be submitted back. Open source can only work if people contribute things back.



ChangeLog
=========
- 1.0
Initial version, way back.


- 1.2
Discovery of K2 servers using the Discovery protocol (fixed by Kenny Cheng).
